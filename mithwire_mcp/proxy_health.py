"""Pre-launch proxy health check.

A session that is *meant* to use a proxy must not silently fall back to the
host's direct connection — that defeats the entire identity model (real IP
leaks into login flows, the timezone/language we then auto-align to is the
WRONG country, and any persistent profile gets cross-contaminated). So when
``start_session`` is given a proxy, we probe it *before* the browser is
spawned and refuse to launch on failure.

The probe issues a ``GET`` to ``api.ipapi.is`` **through the proxy**, with
credentials when present. The same response is the canonical source we use to
derive the default identity (timezone, language, geo) — so the probe doubles
as the egress-info lookup that ``MithwireBrowser`` used to do *after* launch
via ``align_timezone_to_proxy``. Doing it pre-launch means we never need to
do it again, and a bad proxy fails fast with no half-launched browser to
clean up.

Notes on the implementation:

* The probe drives a ``urllib.request`` GET through a ``ProxyHandler``. That
  handler does the right thing for *both* possible upstreams: an absolute-form
  ``GET`` over HTTP for ``http://``-shaped targets, and a ``CONNECT`` tunnel
  with TLS for ``https://`` targets. ipapi.is now serves ``https`` only (the
  ``http`` endpoint 301-redirects to it), so we point at the ``http`` URL and
  let urllib follow the redirect through the proxy automatically — that
  exercises the proxy's CONNECT + TLS path the same way the real browser will.
* The synchronous ``urlopen`` runs in a worker thread; the surrounding
  ``asyncio.wait_for`` enforces an async-side deadline regardless of any
  socket-level timer.
* SOCKS proxies get a TCP-only liveness check. We don't support authenticated
  SOCKS in this launch flow, and a full SOCKS5 negotiation just to read JSON
  is more code than it's worth for the small minority of SOCKS users.
  Identity auto-derivation falls back to ``align_timezone_to_proxy`` on the
  live browser for SOCKS sessions.
